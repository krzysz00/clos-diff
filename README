clos-diff is a GPL licensed library which will be able to create and
apply diffs of clos objects in a compact representation that will not
use too much bandwidth or disk space. The only dependency will by
closer-mop.

The API is simple, and documented below:

function: clos-diff:diff (old new &key (test #'equalp))
  This function will create a diff that represents the modification
  that need to be applied to object old to create the object new. The
  test paremeter will control the test used for equality. As a special
  case is the old parameter is nil, a diff from an object with no
  bound slots will be created.

function: clos-diff:apply (diff &optional object)
  This function will apply the diff given in the parameter diff to the
  object contained in object. If object is nil, a fresh object of the
  appripriate type (with all slots unbound) will be created, and the
  diff will be applied to that (See the documentation for diff for
  more information).
